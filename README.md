This repository is made for storing translation files, issues and releases of Evraon application.

## Issues
If you have any issue with Evraon, please, report them here. I will be glad to help you as soon as possible.  

## For native speakers
If you want to translate the app to your language you are more than welcome:)
I will be posting here some strings files that are used in UI + server part of the app. My native language is Russian so it can be used as a starting point.

## Releases for a server
Server part of the app will be in [Releases](https://github.com/avently/Evraon/releases) section

## Releases for mobile
You can find release for mobile in [Telegram group](https://t.me/evraon) or in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evraon.trading)
